// Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.

// The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.
// Then it converts (“compiles”) the script to machine code.
// And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.

// Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or the CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it
